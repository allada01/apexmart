This is just the initial stage of the application to showcase my skills that I can update and fetch the data from the database and use React to develop a Front-End app.


Directions-
1. First Login 
2. Then your email address and username will be stored in the storage (you can see it in the console) 
3. Then Add items to the homepage by clicking on the "Add Products" once you save the items that will automatically be added in the homepage and also in the database
4. Then if you click on "Add to Cart" all the products will be added to the "Cart" button you can click and continue.
5. Then you will be directed to the page where your all the details of your purchase will be displayed in the table form with the Total Price
6. You can proceed to make a payment( I am working on it )


I will add the payment method soon. But, by that time atleast this project showcases my skills to work with React and Backend application like Firebase.


Thank You!!!
